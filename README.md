# Optimizing-Real-Time-NLP-for-Threat-Detection-
This project enhances cybersecurity by optimizing NLP models for speed, efficiency, and accuracy in real-time threat detection. It leverages model compression (TinyBERT, DistilBERT), streaming pipelines (Kafka, Redis, FastAPI), smart caching, and Edge AI (ONNX Runtime) to ensure low-latency, high-precision threat analysis.
